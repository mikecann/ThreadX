# ThreadX

This is a demo application that I built to experiment with the Backend as a Service platform [Convex](https://convex.dev).

It's called ThreadX because it's a subset of Twitter / Threads / X like functionality.

Some of the ways I have implemented the code may not be 100% optimal, and not all the features are necessarily implemented in the best way. I'm mainly trying to test the waters with Convex and see what it can do.

## Writeup & Demo

I have done a full writeup of this on my blog, you can read about it here: https://mikecann.co.uk/posts/tinkering-with-convex

I have also created a demo video for the project here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTYDdVEg1us

## Install

You should be able to download and then `yarn install` then `yarn dev` to have it run locally.

It will require a Convex account to work but running `yarn dev` will take you through that.
