# ThreadX

This is a demo application that I built to experiment with the Backend as a Service platform [Convex](https://convex.dev).

It's called ThreadX because it's a subset of Twitter / Threads / X like functionality.

## Install

You should be able to download and then `yarn install` then `yarn dev` to have it run locally. 

It will require a Convex account to work but running `yarn dev` will take you through that.
